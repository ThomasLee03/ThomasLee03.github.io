            <h3>Assignment 0: Dummy Assignment</h3>
            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I created a simple Python script that defines two variables for the numbers, adds them, and prints the result using the `print()` function.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We analyzed elevator arrival data to calculate the probability of each elevator arriving next, based on their average frequencies. Using these probabilities, a weighted average of the elevator coordinates is computed to find the optimal waiting position that minimizes walking distance. Finally, the effectiveness of this "smart" position is evaluated by comparing the average walking distances from both the initial guess and the calculated position on test data. </p>

            <h3>Assignment 2: KMeans Clustering Visualization Webpage</h3>
            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> This project is a full-stack web application for visualizing KMeans clustering, built using Python (Flask) for the backend, and JavaScript for the interactive front-end. Flask serves the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and can handle backend logic. Users can generate datasets, select initialization methods (Random, Farthest First, KMeans++, or Manual), and watch the clustering process step-by-step or to full convergence. The front-end, implemented with JavaScript, handles dataset creation, centroid placement, and cluster assignment, while CSS is used to style the interface. The entire KMeans algorithm is implemented from scratch using JavaScript. </p>
